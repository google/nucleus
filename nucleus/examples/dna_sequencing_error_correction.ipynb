        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we formulate DNA sequencing error correction as a multiclass classification problem and propose two deep learning solutions. Our first approach corrects errors in a single read, whereas the second approach, shown in Figure 1, builds a consensus from several reads to predict the correct DNA sequence. We implement the second approach using the [Nucleus](https://github.com/google/nucleus) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) libraries. Our goal is to show how Nucleus can be used alongside TensorFlow for solving machine learning problems in genomics.\n",

        "### Problem Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "While DNA sequencing continues to become faster and cheaper, it is still an error-prone process. Error rates for raw data from next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies developed by companies such as [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/) are around 0.1-1%. Error rates for increasingly popular third-generation technologies like those developed by [Pacific BioSciences](https://www.pacb.com/) (PacBio) are around 15%. Sequencing errors can be divided into substitutions, insertions, and deletions, the last two of which are commonly referred to as indels.  All of these errors can be detrimental to downstream analysis steps such as variant calling and genome assembly, which require accurate data.\n",
        "\n",
        "A simple approach for obtaining higher quality datasets is to discard data that likely contains errors, either by throwing away entire reads or trimming regions of low quality. This approach is not ideal as it leads to a smaller final dataset. In addition, certain sequence contexts have naturally higher error rates, leading to biases in sampling. Thus, there exists a large body of research that is focused on developing more sophisticated methods for error correction. Most methods that have been developed can be categorized into one of two groups:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Methods that operate on a single read and aim to determine the correct read sequence\n",
        "1. Consensus-based methods that operate on several reads and aim to determine the correct underlying DNA sequence\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Deep Learning Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Both of the methods that we formulate in this post use deep neural networks, which learn functions that map inputs to outputs. A neural network consists of several layers of linear and nonlinear operations applied sequentially to the input. Neural networks have been successfully applied to various problems including [image classification](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/03/train-your-own-image-classifier-with.html) and [natural language translation](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/09/a-neural-network-for-machine.html). More recently, they have also been used for problems in genomics, such as [protein structure prediction](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphafold/) and [variant calling](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/12/deepvariant-highly-accurate-genomes.html).\n",

        "\n",
        "Our implementation relies on [Nucleus](https://github.com/google/nucleus), a library developed for processing genomics data by the Genomics team in Google Brain. Nucleus makes it easy to read, write, and analyze data in common genomics file formats like BAM, FASTA, and VCF using specialized reader and writer objects. Nucleus allows us to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Query a VCF file for all variants in a given genomic region\n",
        "* Query a BAM file for all reads mapping to a given genomic range\n",
        "* Query a FASTA file for the reference sequence starting at a given position\n",
        "\n",
        "We also use Nucleus to write data out to [TFRecords](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tf-records), a binary file format that consists of protocol buffer messages and can be easily read by TensorFlow. After reading in the TFRecords, we use the [Estimator API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/estimators) to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network.\n",

Convolutional filters appearing early in the network learn to recognize low-level features in the input, like edges and color gradients in images, whereas later filters learn to recognize more complex compositions of the low-level features. For DNA sequence inputs, low-level convolutional filters act as motif detectors, similar to the position weight matrices of [sequence logos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_weight_matrix#/media/File:LexA_gram_positive_bacteria_sequence_logo.png).\n",

Note, we do not include a softmax layer after the final fully connected layer as the `sparse_softmax_cross_entropy` loss function in TensorFlow expects unscaled logits and applies the softmax internally.

The input to this network is a matrix of normalized base counts observed in mapped reads, centered around the position at which we wish to predict the correct base. A similar featurization is used by the authors of [Clairvoyante](https://doi.org/10.1101/310458), a neural network for variant calling, and in an [example method by Jason Chin](https://towardsdatascience.com/simple-convolution-neural-network-for-genomic-variant-calling-with-tensorflow-c085dbc2026f). The output of the network is a distribution over the possible bases, and the final prediction is the base with highest probability. Similar to the first approach, the label set is generated using the bases observed in the reference genome. We use a mix of examples that contain errors (at least one read in the pileup does not match the reference at the center position) and examples that do not contain errors (all reads in the pileup match the reference at the center position).\n",
